#  Heart Disease Classification

This project is focused on building a machine learning model to classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical attributes.



##  What I Did

- Trained a machine learning classification model
- Tuned hyperparameters to improve performance
- Visualized key patterns and distributions
- Analyzed feature importance to understand which factors influence the prediction most



##  Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- scikit-learn  
- pandas & numpy  
- matplotlib  



##  Outcome

A working model that can help predict heart disease likelihood based on key medical features.



## ðŸ“Œ Note

This is a personal learning project aimed at applying core ML concepts and improving model explainability.
